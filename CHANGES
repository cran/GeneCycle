        CHANGES IN GeneCycle VERSION 1.1.4
- Fixed issues in robust regression, credit to David Laloum

        CHANGES IN GeneCycle VERSION 1.1.3
- inst/doc/wichert-table2.R missing comment symbol added
- R/robust.spectrum.R explicit require command removed

		CHANGES IN GeneCycle VERSION 1.1.2
- Fixed typo in help of avgp (avpg -> avgp)
- Repackaged to compress .rda.

		CHANGES IN GeneCycle VERSION 1.1.1

- major bug fixes for the known-frequency robust
  regression -based periodicity detector (rendering 
  the implementation useless). Mainly:

  1) misindexing of a matrix crashed the evaluation
     of p-values

  2) squaring of one of the two sinusoidal coefficients
     was missing in evaluating the test statistic


		CHANGES IN GeneCycle VERSION 1.1.0

- major update, maintainer changed to Miika Ahdesmaki

  1) implements now also the robust regression based periodicity
     detection method introduced in Ahdesmaki et al. (2007)


		CHANGES IN GeneCycle VERSION 1.0.4

- this update fixes two bugs discoved by Sue Wilson 
  (Australian National University):

  1) in fisher.g.test() the intensity belonging to
     the frequency \pi (or 1/2) is not any more taken
     into account when computing the g-statistic.
     In previous versions for an even number of time points
     thw peak at \pi was incorrectly included.

  2) similary, in robust.g.test() the frequency at zero
     was previously (incorrectly) included into the the g-statistic.


		CHANGES IN GeneCycle VERSION 1.0.3

- small changes to make the package work with fdrtool version 1.2.1.


		CHANGES IN GeneCycle VERSION 1.0.2

- the package was modifed in response to changes in the "fdrtool" package.
  Specifically, the examples on the help pages and also in the "doc" directly
  were modified to work with fdrtool version 1.1.0.


		CHANGES IN GeneCycle VERSION 1.0.1
		
- bug fix in function is.constant()		

		
		CHANGES IN GeneCycle VERSION 1.0.0


This is the first standalone release (9 August 2006).
Previously, the functions available in this package were part of
the GeneTS package (version 2.10.2).
